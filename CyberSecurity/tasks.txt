To do: Batuhan Hıdıroğlu, Matthew Falcone
1. Learn about spoofing methods
    1.a GPS Spoofing: Sending fake GPS signals to the drone so it thinks it's in a different location. This can make it drift off course, land in the wrong place, or crash.

    1.b Command & Control (C2) Spoofing: Imitating the drone’s legitimate ground control station to take over the control link. This requires knowledge of the drone's communication protocol.

    1.c Sensor Spoofing: Feeding false data to onboard sensors like IMUs, cameras, or LiDAR. For example, using lasers to blind cameras or emitters to spoof ultrasonic or infrared rangefinders.

    1.d Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Spoofing: For consumer drones that rely on Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, an attacker can impersonate the controller or interfere with the connection to gain access or deny service.

2. Simulate these in AirSim
3. Come up with ways to evade them in AirSim and measure success/failure



Daily 12-05-2024: DONE
The cybersecurity team will look into and learn about existing methods to disrupt drones by EOD. GPS spoofing, RF jamming and many more methods will be researched.
